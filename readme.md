# Austin Breslin's JS/TS Libraries

A collection of libraries that I felt were missing from the public and people could potentially want.

## List:

[@austinbreslin/file-types](./packages/fileTypes/readme.md)
[@austinbreslin/pledge](./packages/pledge/readme.md)
[@austinbreslin/fetcher](./packages/fetcher/readme.md)
[@austinbreslin/safe-json](./packages/safe-json/readme.md)

## File Types

File Types is near completion list of file type information, including the 'magic bits' that determine
what application the file belongs to.

## Pledge

A wrapper around promises to return tuples with a few other useful features.

## Fetcher

A wrapper around fetch to return tuples, not throw random errors and with a few other useful features.

## Safe JSON

Correcting a few inconsistencies when use JSON in JS/TS. Does not throw random errors.
